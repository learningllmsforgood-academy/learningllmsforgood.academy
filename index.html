<h2>What?</h2>
<p>
If you've used ChatGPT, you might have felt it is a fundamentally new tech! If yes, then please continue reading ...<br><br>
With any new fundamental tech, people slowly realize its potential and build new applications on top of it.<br><br>
I personally want to do that. I have some vauge ideas. But personally, I don't understand this tech enough. Also have very limited (almost non-existent) understanding of the business aspects around it enough right now. I want to learn / find the right people to delegate work. To build something / help somebody else build something! Something good! To make the world a slightly better place ü§ó.<br><br>
<a href="https://learningllmsforgood.academy">learningllmsforgood.academy</a> is a place to collaboratively to learn together. Right now it'll mostly be from a software engineering, maths, ML and DS perspective because that it what I know best.<br>
To build successful applications we also need a business perspective. Right now I don't have that. I encourge folks with business & ops perspective to also join at a later date.
