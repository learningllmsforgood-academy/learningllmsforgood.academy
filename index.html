  <h2>What?</h2>
  <p>
  If you've used ChatGPT, you might have felt it is a fundamentally <b>new technology</b>! Yes? ...<br><br>
  With any new fundamental tech, people <b>slowly</b> realize its potential. And build <b>new</b> apps.<br><br>
  <p class="motivation">
  We personally want to do that. We have some ideas. But. Right now. We don't understand this tech enough.<br>
  I have limited understanding & ideas about the business aspects around it.<br>
  We want to learn. And find the right people. Build a team.<br>
  To build something. Or help somebody else build something! Something good!<br>
  To make the world a slightly better place 🤗.<br><br>
  </p>

  <b><a href="https://learningllmsforgood.academy">This</a></b> is a place for learning. To collaboratively learn together.
